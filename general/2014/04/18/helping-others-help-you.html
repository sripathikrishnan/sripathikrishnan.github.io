<div class="post">
<p>This morning I was lying down on bed. Had a cup of tea in my hand, and was reading the newspaper. Curled up in a blanket, feeling lazy. </p>

<p>Our maid Bhagya was cleaning the house. She&#39;s been with us for several years now, so she knows how lazy we are. She doesn&#39;t expect us to move even a bit, especially on a Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Every month or so, she takes old news papers from our home. Being lazy, we are glad someone is cleaning up for us; but for her it is extra money earned. Win-win situation.</p>

<p>Except, there is small hiccup. The evil security guard thinks that the maid is stealing stuff. He demands a &quot;gate pass&quot;, a signed letter that says &quot;Please allow Bhagya to take old newspapers&quot;. Whoever said security and convenience was possible was either drunk or doped.</p>

<p>Anyways, finding a sheet of paper and a pen that works on a Sunday morning, when all you want is to get some more sleep, is just impossible. &quot;Bhagya, kal leke jaana&quot; is what I have told her several times in the past.</p>

<p>Back to this morning. Bhagya nicely bundles up the old newspapers. As a bonus, she cleans up the corner where we dump newspapers. She finds a pamphlet within the newspapers, one that is blank on the reverse side. She tries a couple of pens, and magically finds one that works.</p>

<p>And then she comes to my bed, hands me the pen and pamphlet, smiles, and tells me &quot;Bhaiya, gate pass bano do&quot;. I don&#39;t have to move an inch!</p>

<p>Small things that make your day!</p>
